The following is a list of known issues in each version of this software:


Version 1.0:

- Camera characterization:

	* Clicking on "select sample" creates a new pixel selection handle every time. While this should not be a big issue, it is worth noting that "store sample" will only sample those pixels selected by the last created handle, ignoring any other existing selection handle.

	* Pasting radiance values from an external file throws a button callback error when numbers use a decimal digit separator other than a point.

	Error Message: "Error using reshape"
